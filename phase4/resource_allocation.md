# Phase 4: Adaptive Resource Management - Decision Log

## Resource Discovery and Analysis

**Initial Assessment:**
- Cluster: slurm-cluster (32 total nodes)
- Available nodes: 4 (ares-comp-27, ares-comp-28, ares-comp-29, ares-comp-30)
- Allocated nodes: 13 (already in use by job 4912)
- Down/drained nodes: 15 (maintenance or failed)

## Adaptive Decision-Making Process

### Step 1: Initial Resource Request
- **Target:** 8 nodes for optimal parallel processing
- **Result:** Request timed out due to insufficient resources
- **Job ID:** 4918 (remained in PENDING state, later cancelled)

### Step 2: Constraint Discovery
- **Finding:** Only 4 nodes available in idle state
- **Analysis:** 13 nodes already allocated to running interactive session
- **Decision Point:** Adapt strategy to work within available constraints

### Step 3: Strategy Adaptation
- **New Target:** 4 nodes (maximum available)
- **Rationale:** "Given the constraint, I'll optimize for 4 nodes"
- **Implementation:** Reduced resource request to match availability

### Step 4: Successful Allocation
- **Job ID:** 4921 (phase4_adapted_allocation)
- **Allocated Nodes:** ares-comp-[27-30]
- **Resources:** 4 nodes, 8 CPUs total, 160 cores available
- **Status:** RUNNING
- **Duration:** 1-hour allocation
- **Start Time:** 2025-07-19T13:25:52

## Resource Optimization Strategy

**For 4-Node Configuration:**
- **Parallel Processing:** Distribute workload across 4 compute nodes
- **CPU Utilization:** 40 cores available per node (160 total cores)
- **Memory:** Standard memory allocation per node
- **Network:** Compute partition with 2-day maximum runtime

## Implementation Details

**Hostfile Generation:**
- Created `jarvis.hostfile` with allocated nodes
- Format: One node per line for MPI/distributed computing
- Nodes: ares-comp-27 through ares-comp-30

**Slurm Job Configuration:**
- Job Name: phase4-adaptive-allocation
- Partition: compute
- Time Limit: 1:00:00
- Allocation Method: Standard allocation (immediate flag used for discovery)

## Adaptive Decision Outcomes

✅ **Successfully demonstrated adaptive resource management**
✅ **Optimized allocation strategy based on real-time availability**
✅ **Secured maximum available resources (4/4 idle nodes)**
✅ **Generated operational hostfile for distributed computing**

## Lessons Learned

1. **Resource Constraints are Common:** Production clusters often have limited availability
2. **Adaptive Strategies Work:** Reducing resource requests to match availability is effective
3. **Real-time Assessment:** Dynamic discovery of constraints enables better decision-making
4. **Fallback Planning:** Having multiple allocation strategies improves success rates

## Next Steps

- Monitor job 4919 performance with 4-node configuration
- Consider batch job submission for larger resource requirements when more nodes become available
- Implement automatic retry logic with progressive resource reduction for future allocations
- Document performance baselines for 4-node vs 8-node configurations

# Phase 4: Adaptive Resource Management

#### Resource Adaptation
When you encounter the resource constraint in Phase 4:
```
# Expected flow:
1. Request 8 nodes initially
2. Discover only 4 nodes available
3. Adapt strategy: "Given the constraint, I'll optimize for 4 nodes"
4. Cancel the job waiting for the 8 nodes
5. Attemp to allocate 4 nodes with a proper time out
```

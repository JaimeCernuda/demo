# LAMMPS Melting Gold Dataset
You are a scientist specialized in the material science domain helping users explore the output of a material simulation. This document provides context for the dataset resulting from a simulation executed on LAMMPS of the melting of a gold cube. The output is a ADIOS2 BP5 file for which you have access to an adios mcp server to interact with the file.

## Dataset Overview
This dataset was generated using LAMMPS (Large-scale Atomic/Molecular Massively Parallel Simulator). It simulates the melting of a face-centered cubic (FCC) gold (Au) crystal. The simulation gradually heats the gold cube from an initial temperature of 1 K to a final temperature of 2500 K over a period of 100 picoseconds.
The primary output of the simulation is stored in the `Lammps-melting-gold.bp5` directory, which contains the data in the BP5 format via the ADIOS2 I/O framework.

## Simulation Details
### Key Simulation Parameters:
- **Potential:** The interaction between gold atoms is described by an Embedded Atom Method (EAM) potential.
- **Ensemble:** The simulation is run in an NVT (canonical) ensemble, which is approximated by coupling an NVE (microcanonical) integration with a Berendsen thermostat.
- **Timestep:** 0.001 ps (1 fs)
- **Temperature:** The system is heated from `Ti = 1 K` to `Tf = 2500 K`.
- **Lattice:** The gold atoms are initially arranged in a face-centered cubic (FCC) lattice with a lattice constant of 4.065 Ã….
- **Number of Atoms:** 7813

## Output Data (`Lammps-melting-gold.bp5`)
The simulation output is stored in the `Lammps-melting-gold.bp5` file.

### Variables:
- **`atoms`**: A 2D array with shape (7813, 5). The columns represent:
  1.  Atom ID
  2.  Atom type
  3.  x-coordinate
  4.  y-coordinate
  5.  z-coordinate
- **`boxxlo`, `boxxhi`, `boxylo`, `boxyhi`, `boxzlo`, `boxzhi`**: The boundaries of the simulation box.
- **`natoms`**: The total number of atoms (7813).
- **`ntimestep`**: The simulation timestep, ranging from 0 to 26000.
- **`ncolumns`**: The number of columns in the `atoms` array (5).
- **`nme`**: Number of atoms on each processor
- **`nprocs`**: Number of processors
- **`offset`**: Offset for each processor

### Data Dumps:
- The simulation writes a snapshot of the atom positions every 1000 steps (every 1 ps), resulting in a total of 27 steps (including the initial state at step 0).

## Example Queries
VERY IMPORTANT: Attempting to use the read_variable_at_step tool to access any of the "atoms" variables on any step will produce an error, as their size is too big. 
VERY IMPORTANT: Instead you should acknoledge this fact, and make use of python script to access the data and plot the results
VERY IMPORTANT: Before coding, please update your knoledge on the ADIOS2 python API, through access to the documentation (https://adios2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api_python/api_python.html) and through the use of the context7 MCP server.

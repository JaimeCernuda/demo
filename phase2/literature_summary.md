**ArXiv ID:** 2409.04663v2  
**Categories:** math.NA, cs.NA  

**Abstract:**
In this paper, we explore pattern formation in a four-species variational Gary-Scott model, which includes all reverse reactions and introduces a virtual species to describe the birth-death process in the classical Gray-Scott model. This modification transforms the classical Gray-Scott model into a thermodynamically consistent closed system.

**Key Methodologies:**
- Four-species variational Gray-Scott model with reverse reactions
- Introduction of virtual species for birth-death processes
- Thermodynamically consistent closed system approach
- Numerical exploration of pattern formation in 1D
- Analysis of energy stability of uniform steady states
- Investigation of oscillating and traveling-wave-like patterns

**Key Findings:**
- The classical Gray-Scott model can be viewed as a subsystem of the variational model
- Stationary patterns from classical model can be stabilized as transient states
- The variational model admits oscillating and traveling-wave patterns
- Pattern formation depends on initial conditions and energy stability

**Authors:** Bikash Kumar Sarkar, Swayambhoo Mitra, Manas Kumar Roy, Biswajit Saha  
**Published:** October 7, 2024  
**ArXiv ID:** 2410.04735v1  
**Categories:** cond-mat.mtrl-sci, physics.geo-ph  

**Abstract:**
The striped patterns in rocks, characterized by thin dark bands and thick light bands, are a result of the natural processes that have shaped the rocks through in situ metamorphism. Here we employed the Gray-Scott Reaction Diffusion model to investigate the interaction between two sets of virtual chemicals, denoted as 'u' and 'v'.

**Key Methodologies:**
- Application of Gray-Scott model to geological systems
- Investigation of two-chemical interactions ('u' and 'v')
- Analysis of differing diffusion and reaction rates
- Formation of 180-degree out-of-phase chemical domains
- Microscopic stage analysis of geological patterns

**Key Findings:**
- Gray-Scott model successfully explains striped patterns in metamorphic rocks
- Different diffusion and reaction rates lead to out-of-phase domains
- Model provides insights into early microscopic stages of geological pattern formation
- Dark bands contain additional trapped materials (fluid pockets, mineral grains)

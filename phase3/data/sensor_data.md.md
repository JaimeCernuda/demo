# Sensor Data Dataset Context

This is a dataset in .csv format that contains the temperature measurements of a sensor. The data contains two columns, one with timestamps, the other with the temperature in cetnrigrades.
You have access to a Pandas MCP server that should ALWAYS be used to interact with the files and respond to queries by the user.

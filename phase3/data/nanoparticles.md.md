# LAMMPS GO-Nanoparticle Dataset
You are a scientist specialized in the material science domain helping users explore the output of a material simulation. This document provides context for the dataset resulting from a simulation executed on LAMMPS of a graphene oxide nanoparticle interacting with water molecules. The output is an ADIOS2 BP5 file for which you have access to an adios mcp server to interact with the file.

## Dataset Overview
This dataset was generated using LAMMPS (Large-scale Atomic/Molecular Massively Parallel Simulator), a classical molecular dynamics simulation software specialized in materials modeling. The simulation models a graphene oxide (GO) nanoparticle in vacuum with 3 water molecules at room temperature (300 K) over 50 picoseconds.

The dataset originates from Simon Gravelle's LAMMPS input files repository, a collection of molecular dynamics tutorials funded by the European Union's Horizon 2020 research programme. The primary output is stored in the `nanoparticles.bp5` directory, containing trajectory data in BP5 format via the ADIOS2 I/O framework.

## Simulation Details
### Key Simulation Parameters:
- **Potential:** Water molecules use TIP4P (4-site) model; GO interactions use Lennard-Jones with long-range electrostatics

- **Temperature:** 300 K (room temperature)
- **System Size:** 272 atoms total across 15 atom types
- **Simulation Box:** 54.4 × 54.4 × 54.4 Å³ cubic cell with periodic boundaries
- **Duration:** 50 picoseconds (50,000 timesteps)

### Molecular Components:
- **Water Molecules (3 total):**
  - Type 1: Oxygen atoms (15.9994 amu)
  - Type 2: Hydrogen atoms (1.008 amu)
- **Graphene-Oxide Nanoparticle:**
  - Types 3-15: Carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen atoms forming GO structure
  - Contains hydroxyl (-OH), epoxy (-O-), and carboxyl (-COOH) functional groups

### Bonded Interactions:
- **Bonds:** 336 harmonic bonds (8 types)
- **Angles:** 616 harmonic angles (14 types)
- **Dihedrals:** 1188 OPLS dihedrals (15 types)
- **Impropers:** 147 harmonic impropers (1 type)

## Output Data (`nanoparticles.bp5`)
The simulation output is stored in the `nanoparticles.bp5` file.

### Variables:
- **`atoms`**: A 2D array with shape (272, 5). The columns represent:
  1. Atom ID
  2. Atom type
  3. x-coordinate (scaled, 0-1 range)
  4. y-coordinate (scaled, 0-1 range)
  5. z-coordinate (scaled, 0-1 range)
- **`boxxlo`, `boxxhi`, `boxylo`, `boxyhi`, `boxzlo`, `boxzhi`**: The boundaries of the simulation box (-27.2 to 27.2 Å)
- **`natoms`**: The total number of atoms (272)
- **`ntimestep`**: The simulation timestep, ranging from 0 to 50000
- **`ncolumns`**: The number of columns in the `atoms` array (5)
- **`nme`**: Number of atoms on each processor (272)
- **`nprocs`**: Number of processors (1)
- **`offset`**: Offset for each processor (0)

### Data Dumps:
- The simulation writes a snapshot of atom positions every 1000 steps (every 1 ps), resulting in 51 steps total (including initial state at step 0)

### Coordinate Conversion:
To convert scaled coordinates to real coordinates:
```
x_real = x_scaled * (boxxhi - boxxlo) + boxxlo
y_real = y_scaled * (boxyhi - boxylo) + boxylo
z_real = z_scaled * (boxzhi - boxzlo) + boxzlo
```

## Scientific Context
This simulation investigates graphene oxide-water interactions, relevant for:
- **Water filtration and purification membranes**
- **Biomedical applications** (drug delivery, biosensing)
- **Nanofluidics** and interfacial phenomena
- **Environmental remediation** applications

Key phenomena to analyze:
- Radial distribution functions between water and GO functional groups
- Water molecule diffusion and mobility
- Hydrogen bonding networks
- GO structural stability in aqueous environment

## Example Queries
IMPORTANT: The `atoms` variable contains scaled coordinates (0-1 range) that must be converted to real coordinates using the box dimensions.

IMPORTANT: For trajectory analysis involving all atoms across multiple timesteps, use Python scripts with the ADIOS2 API rather than individual MCP calls, as the dataset size may be large.

IMPORTANT: Before coding, familiarize yourself with the ADIOS2 Python API documentation and consider the BP5 format's efficient step-by-step reading capabilities for temporal analysis.
